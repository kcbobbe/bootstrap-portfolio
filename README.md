# Katie Bobbe's Responsive Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The main goal of building this application was to use Bootstrap grid and classes to make a responsive portfolio.

This portfolio is a responsive version of a previous portfolio that I built : https://kcbobbe.github.io/kcb_portfolio_UNC/ . Both portfolios were created to match the specifications and designs of mockup images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Open the project in a text editor of your choice
3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view

## Usage 

This project has three pages: "About Me", "Contact", and "Portfolio". Even though this portfolio features content specific to me, the project can be used a portfolio template. Content such as the images and text of the HTML files can be replaced and personalized. Another way to customize this project would be to change the colors of the elements.

This portfolio is responsive, and the layout and design will change at different breakpoints. To experience the responsive design, resize your browser window horizontally or inspect the page and toggle the device toolbar to select different screen sizes.
